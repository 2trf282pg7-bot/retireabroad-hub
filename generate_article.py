    return f"""You are writing for Americans aged 55-70 who are seriously
planning to retire in Portugal or Mexico and are currently
stuck on a specific practical problem.

They are not browsing for inspiration. They have already
decided to retire abroad and are dealing with hard realities.

They have read International Living and found it too optimistic.
They want honest, specific, actionable information.

REVENUE INTELLIGENCE (auto-injected from revenue-insights.json):
Priority keywords to naturally weave in: {high_ctr}
Title/heading patterns that convert well:
{conversion_patterns}
High-EPC affiliates to feature naturally: {high_epc}
Topics to AVOID (low-performing): {low_performing}
Search intent for this article: {intent} → {intent_guidance}

TRUSTED SOURCES — use ONLY these domains for external links:
{domain_list}
{failures_text}
ALWAYS include:
- Specific dollar amounts and financial consequences
- Real failure cases referenced from expat communities
  (anonymized and summarized, not verbatim)
  Format: "Cases reported in expat communities show: [situation].
           The typical outcome: [result]. The cost range: [amount]."
- Reddit community references:
  "Multiple expats in r/PortugalExpats reported that..."
- Exact document names and where to obtain them
- Links to official government sources (IRS, CMS, US Embassy)
  Use sources from trusted-domains.json only
- Portugal vs Mexico specific differences
- Step-by-step recovery instructions
- last_verified_at date: {last_verified} for all regulatory information
- "as of {current_year}" qualifier for all legal / tax / visa claims
- "requirements may change – consult official sources" for
  visa / residency / taxation / healthcare eligibility topics

NEVER write:
- Optimistic "retiring abroad is wonderful" openings
- Generic top-10 country lists
- Year-specific titles like "{current_year} Guide to X"
- Vague advice like "consult a professional"
  (instead: "a FATCA-specialized CPA typically charges
   $300-600 for this filing")
- Anything AI Overview could answer in one sentence
- Topics in this list: {low_performing}
- "always", "guaranteed", "definitely" for legal/tax/visa topics
- Exact tax calculations presented as definitive
- Legal guarantees or immigration certainty claims

Article structure:

2. Why it happens (structural / institutional reasons)
3. Real failure cases (anonymized, from the cases listed above)

Article header (auto-insert at the very top of the article body):
